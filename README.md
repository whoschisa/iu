# IU Bot

## Terms of Service

### Usage Agreement
By inviting the bot and using its features (commands, welcome system), you agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy (Policy) outlined below.

You acknowledge that you have the privilege to use the bot freely on any Discord Server (Server) you share with it, and that you can invite it to any Server for which you have "Manage Server" rights. This privilege may be revoked if you violate the terms and/or policy of this bot, or the [Terms of Service], [Privacy Policy], and/or [Community Guidelines] of [Discord Inc][discord].

Upon inviting the bot, it may collect specific data as described in its [Policy](#privacy-policy).  
The intended use of this data is for core functionalities of the bot, such as command handling, guild-specific settings, and the Welcoming System.

### Intended Age
The bot may not be used by individuals under the minimum age described in Discord's Terms of Service.  
Features such as commands marked "NSFW" (Not Safe for Work) may not be used by individuals under the age of maturity in their country. Violating this will result in the botâ€™s removal from any servers you own.

### Affiliation
The Bot is not affiliated with, supported, or made by Discord Inc.  
Any direct connection to Discord or any of its Trademark objects is purely coincidental. We do not claim copyright ownership of any of Discord's assets, trademarks, or other intellectual property.

### Liability
The owner of the bot may not be held liable for individuals breaking these Terms at any time.  
We trust users to be truthful about their information and not misuse this bot or the services of Discord Inc in a malicious way.

We reserve the right to update these terms at our own discretion, giving you a 1-week (7 days) period to opt out if you do not agree with the new changes.  
To opt out, simply remove the bot from any Server you have access to.

### Contact
Users may contact us via email at support@lapisbot.xyz, or through the official [Support Discord][support] of the Bot.  
Other support methods may be provided but are not guaranteed.

## Privacy Policy

### Usage of Data
The bot may use stored data, as defined below, for features including but not limited to: Welcoming joining users (when enabled) and command handling.  
No data outside of the aforementioned cases will be used, nor will data be shared with any third-party site or service.

### Stored Information
The bot may store the following information automatically when invited to a new Discord Server:

- `id` with the Server's ID as value.
- `prefix` with value `+`

No other information outside of the above-mentioned data will be stored.

### Updating Data
The data may be updated when using specific commands.  
Updating data requires user input, and sensitive data, such as the content of a message, may need to be stored when using certain commands.

No other actions will update the stored information at any time.

### Temporarily Stored Information
The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal caching mechanism for a specific period.  
After this period, the cached information will be removed and only re-added when required.

Data may be prematurely removed from the cache through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.

### Removal of Data

#### Automatic removal
Stored data can be removed automatically by removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server. Re-inviting the bot will add the same default values, as previously mentioned, back to the bot's database.

#### Manual removal
Manual removal of data can be requested via email at support@iu.xyz.  
For security reasons, we will ask for proof of ownership of the server for which data removal is requested. Only a server owner may request data removal, and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server if it is still present.

!!! info "Technical limitations"
    Automatic data removal has limitations that we cannot control or avoid.  
    These limitations include, but are not limited to, downtime due to bot maintenance or technical issues from our hosting provider or Discord Inc.
    
    In such cases, you can request [manual removal](#manual-removal) via email under the conditions mentioned above.
